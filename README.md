# My Dotfiles

My dotfiles and general development environment settings.
Mostly cobbled together by copying stuff I liked from other people.
I'd give credit, but I forget everywhere I found stuff.

Yes, I use both Vim and Emacs.
Org-mode is really nice.

Not magic at this point.
You can brute-force it if you want, but I'd just recommend copy-and-pasting the bits you like.
